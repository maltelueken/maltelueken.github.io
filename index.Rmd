I am a Research Software Engineer at the Netherlands eScience Center and PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam.
My work is embedded in the computational social sciences including machine and deep learning, large language models,
network analysis, and applied statistics. My goal is to make new and complex technologies accessible to researchers.
In my PhD, I focus on amortized Bayesian inference for cognitive models of decision
making. In my free time, I enjoy dancing salsa and playing the piano.
